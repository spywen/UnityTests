# UnityTests

Some personal unity tests.

For now looks like a simple project with **dependency injection** and **IoC container** propulsed by **Unity** and **code configured**.

Moreover, thanks to unity extensions: each project dependencies are referenced inside it directly. This avoid to centralized totally the IoC container
<=> here **each project is responsible to reference his own dependencies**.
